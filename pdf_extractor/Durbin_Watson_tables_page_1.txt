1  AppendixADurbin-Watson Significance Tables The Durbin-Watson test statistic tests the null hypothesis that the residuals from an ordinary least-squares regression are not autocorrelated against the alternative that the residuals follow an AR1 process. The Durbin-Watson statistic ranges in value from 0 to 4. A value near 2 indicates non-autocorrelation; a value toward 0 indicates positive autocorrelation; a value toward 4 indicates negative autocorrelation. Because of the dependence of any computed Durbin-Watson value on the associated data matrix, exact critical values of the Durbin-Watson statistic are not tabulated for all possible cases. Instead, Durbin and Watson established upper and lower bounds for the critical values. Typically, tabulated bounds are used to test the hypothesis of zero autocorrelation against the alternative of positive first-order autocorrelation, since positive autocorrelation is seen much more frequently in practice than negative autocorrelation. To use the table, you must cross-reference the sample size against the number of regressors, excluding the constant from the count of the number of regressors. The conventional Durbin-Watson tables are not applicable when you do not have a constant term in the regression. Instead, you must refer to an appropriate set of Durbin-Watson tables. The conventional Durbin-Watson tables are also not applicable when a lagged dependent variable appears among the regressors. Durbin has proposed alternative test procedures for this case. Statisticians have compiled Durbin-Watson tables from some special cases, including:  (cid:132)Regressions with a full set of quarterly seasonal dummies.  (cid:132)Regressions with an intercept and a linear trend variable (CURVEFIT MODEL=LINEAR).  (cid:132)Regressions with a full set of quarterly seasonal dummies and a linear trend variable.
